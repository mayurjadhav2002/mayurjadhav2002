                  I'm Mayur Jadhav, a final-year Computer Science student at
                  Mumbai University. I've got a solid two years of hands-on
                  experience in software development, playing around with cool
                  stuff like Javascript, Python, MERN stack, C, and PHP. I've
                  built desktop apps, mobile apps, websites, and even pitched in
                  on some open source projects.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                  But it's not just about coding for me. I'm also in the know
                  about operations and cloud technologies like AWS, Google
                  Cloud, Docker, and Kubernetes. So, whether it's writing code
                  or managing projects, I've got it covered.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                  I've dipped my toes into the AI pool because, honestly, who
                  isn't fascinated by it? I've dabbled in machine learning
                  models, taken on data science projects, and tried my hand at
                  Natural Language Processing. I'm all about making things
                  easier with tech.
                </p>

                <br></br>
                <p>
                  Internships at Zevo and Cozy Notion taught me how to crank out
                  production-level code. Plus, I've taken on leadership roles,
                  like heading up the coding club and jumping into hackathons.
                  It's been a ride, and it's sharpened my skills and my knack
                  for problem-solving.
                </p>

                <br></br>
                <p>
                  Beyond the tech stuff, I'm always looking to up my game.
                  You'll find me in hackathons and coding competitions during my
                  downtime. And just for kicks, I like to explore No-code
                  Ethical Hacking. Learning is my jam, and I'm all about finding ways.
