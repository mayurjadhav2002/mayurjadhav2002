										During my college years, I was
										determined to make the most of every
										opportunity to grow as a developer. I
										interned at Cozy Notion and Zevo AI,
										where I worked on real-world projects
										that helped sharpen my technical skills
										and taught me how to collaborate
										effectively in professional
										environments. Beyond academics, I took
										part in hackathons, freelanced on
										diverse projects, and worked on personal
										ventures, all of which reinforced my
										love for building solutions and creating
										impactful products. This relentless
										drive to excel and push my limits paved
										the way for my first professional role
										as a Junior Software Engineer at
										Mapsted, where I continue to grow and
										make meaningful contributions.

										Today, I am proficient in an extensive
										range of technologies, including
										TypeScript, React, Node.js, Express.js,
										Next.js, Prisma, Python, Flask, Redux,
										REST APIs, GraphQL, and MongoDB. My
										expertise spans both frontend and
										backend development, complemented by
										hands-on experience with infrastructure
										tools like Git, Docker, AWS, Vercel, and
										Jira. Whether itâ€™s crafting scalable
										applications, contributing to innovative
										products, or solving complex challenges,
										I remain committed to leveraging
										technology to make a difference.
